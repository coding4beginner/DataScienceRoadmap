    "# Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to the corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or decisions when presented with new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a supervised learning scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data (Features):** The algorithm is provided with a set of input data, also known as features. These features represent the characteristics or attributes of the data that are relevant to the learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Labels (Target):** Each input data point is associated with a known output label, also called the target or response variable. The output labels represent the desired prediction or classification for each corresponding input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Process:** During the training phase, the algorithm uses the labeled dataset to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels. The goal is to create a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Building:** The supervised learning algorithm builds a model based on the patterns and relationships identified in the training data. The model captures the underlying mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. The model applies the learned patterns to new input features to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Supervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification:**\n",
    "   - In classification tasks, the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances.\n",
    "   - Example: Spam or not spam, disease diagnosis (positive/negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression:**\n",
    "   - In regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value.\n",
    "   - Example: Predicting house prices, stock prices, or temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data:** The labeled dataset used for training the model.\n",
    "- **Testing Data:** Unseen data used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "- **Features:** The input variables or attributes of the data.\n",
    "- **Labels/Targets:** The desired output or prediction associated with each input.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing how well the model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is widely used in various applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image and speech recognition.\n",
    "- Natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "- Fraud detection.\n",
    "- Autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "- Healthcare for diagnosis and prognosis.\n",
