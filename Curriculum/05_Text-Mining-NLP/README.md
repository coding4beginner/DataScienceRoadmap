# 5_ Text Mining

Text mining is the process of deriving high-quality information from text.

## 1_ Corpus

A Corpus is a large and structured set of texts.

## 2_ Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories.

## 3_ Text Analysis

Text Analysis is the automated process of understanding and sorting unstructured text, making it easier to manage.

## 4_ UIMA

Unstructured Information Management applications (UIMA) are software systems that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user.

## 5_ Term Document matrix

A term-document matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents.

## 6_ Term frequency and Weight

Term frequency is the number of times a term appears in a document. The weight of a term often reflects its importance to a document.

## 7_ Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.

## 8_ Association rules

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other.

## 9_ Market based analysis

Market-based analysis is a method of analyzing market data to help strategize on a company's future market trends.

## 10_ Feature extraction

Feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values intended to be informative and non-redundant.

## 11_ Using mahout

Mahout is a project of the Apache Software Foundation to produce free implementations of distributed or otherwise scalable machine learning algorithms.

## 12_ Using Weka

Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.

## 13_ Using NLTK

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a platform used for building Python programs to work with human language data.

## 14_ Classify text

Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content.

## 15_ Vocabulary mapping

Vocabulary mapping is a process to equate vocabularies from different systems or vocabularies within the same system.
