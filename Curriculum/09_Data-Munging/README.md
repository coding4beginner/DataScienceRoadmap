# 9_ Data Munging

Data Munging, also known as data wrangling, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes.

## 1_ Dimensionality and Numerical reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. Numerical reduction is the process of reducing the amount of data by using techniques like binning, sampling etc.

## 2_ Normalization

Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1.

## 3_ Data scrubbing

Data scrubbing, also known as data cleansing, is the process of cleaning data by correcting or removing errors in datasets.

## 4_ Handling missing Values

Handling missing values involves using techniques to either replace or use statistical analysis to fill in the gaps in data where values are missing.

## 5_ Unbiased estimators

An unbiased estimator is a statistic that's mean or expectation is equal to the parameter it is estimating.

## 6_ Binning Sparse Values

Binning sparse values involves grouping values into bins to handle sparse data or to reduce noise.

## 7_ Feature extraction

Feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values intended to be informative and non-redundant.

## 8_ Denoising

Denoising is the process of removing noise from a signal.

## 9_ Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.

## 10_ Stratified sampling

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population which can be partitioned into subpopulations.

## 11_ PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.
